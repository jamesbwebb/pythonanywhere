# Not sure if my setup will work as the website is asking for lat/long data to be included in the api call.
# while the code below might work the back end supporting the locations is no longer
# being kept up. Proposed solution is to use the suggested geocoder api to get lat/long data for a location and put that in.

# "Please use Geocoder API if you need automatic convert city names and zip-codes to geo coordinates and the other way around."
