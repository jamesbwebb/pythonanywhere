This file will function as general notes on the weather api integration project.

In this project we are using open weather map .org
Signing to get your key or generate a new one
https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_in
FYI, It may take up to 24 hours before your key is activated.

Read the docs, current weather data.
https://openweathermap.org/current

At some point this API went from accepting city name to only accepting lat/lon data, this does require a bit more leg work on our end
but with the same api key we can access a geocoding api which will make this easier for us. This should convert city names and/or zip
codes to lat/lon data.

An issue I have run into is putting "Tucson" into the geocoder and getting South Tucson back from the weather api.
I'll have to look into this issue further.


For final implimentation the weather api does not update more often then every 10 minutes, so maybe do the call to get the data only
after that much time has passed? Not yet sure how to impliment this.


The weather api returns tempurature numbers in Kelvin


The youtube tut I'm working from has a function built to query the api, then sorts the return data into a list and dictionary
which is returned by the function, for use later when building the webpage.



I have finished the youtube tut, and am running into an error with the api key.
I believe I can solve this error be placing the key directly into the views file, instead of trying to obfuscate the text
by was of importing it or reading it from a txt file. But I don't want to do that.
If I try my first version where I'm opening the apikey.txt file and populating the API_KEY variable django says it can't find the file
If I turn the api key into a module django can't find the module when rendering the webpage.

Either solution works perfectly when tested independantly of the webpage.

Problem statement, How can I hide an api key with django? Maybe there is a better way I haven't thought of.

Maybe?
