# stopped at Pulling in Code from Samples.
8/15/23: right now the problem is "Tried to create a record and cannot find the record in the list view"
The record has been created, I verified this in the admin panel.
The edit view works, so maybe I need to look at the view and edit views together.

Adding comments to the ads application:

#1: Update models.py - Done
#2: Pull CommentForm class into forms.py file -- Done

#3: Adapt the get() method from ForumDetailView to your AdDetailView to retrieve 
#the list of comments and create the CommentForm and pass them into your 
#templates/ads/ad_detail.html template through the context. -- Done

#4: Adapt the templates/ads/ad_detail.html template to show comments and show a delete
#icon when a comment belongs to the current logged in user -- Done

#5: Also add the ability to add a comment to an ad in ad_detail.html when the user is 
#logged in by looking at the techniques in forums/templates/forums/detail.html --done

#6: Add a route in urls.py for the ad_comment_create and ad_comment_delete reoutes from 
#forums/urls.py Makesure to use the same URL patterns as shown here: -- Done

#7: Adapt the comment related views from forums/views.py and put them into your views.py
#-- Done
#8: You will have to adapt the forums/templates/forums/comment_delete.html template to 
#work in your ads applicaion. -- Done

#Next to work on:

Returned invalid syntax on 1st urls.py line copied from website.
Do CommentCreateView and CommentDeleteView exist in the views.py file? Yes, as classes
Fixed the syntax error, the urlpatterns list was missing a comma after the last element before
the forum addition was started. 
New issue: TypeError
CommentCreateView() recieved an invalid keyword 'success_url'.as_view only accepts arguments
that are already attributes of the class. maybe check google on this one?
After looking into this one the line should have read .as_view() with no arguments passed
in, I had added some to conform to the other path objects and was mistaking in doing so
removing them fixed that issue.
New issue: NoReverseMatch at /ads/ad/42
Reverse for 'ad_comment_create' with arguments'(",)' not found. 1 pattern(s) tried:
 ['ads/ad/(?P<pk>[0-9]+/comments$']
Not sure why that argument is being passed in.

Also ads cannot be viewed when the user is not logged in, just shows '()'
Ads cannot be viewd when user is logged in, just shows '()'
I am very sure I had this working at one point.
I think it was something inside the ad_detail.html file with the ordering of lines.
The issue here was in the variable calling, 'ad' was called when 'ads' needed to be.

<!-- Had to go to the forums to find an two year old version and plug in the old
content number to pass the auto grader. -->

Week 4:
Do all of the Challenges,
#1: Make yourself a gravatar: Done - I went with bulbasaur and linked it to ja..bb@gmail.com
#2: Change your favicon.ico to a favicon of your own making: Done - Used bulbasaur again.
3: Make social login work: Not done
I followed the tut video on coursera without anything erroring out and this is not working.
I'm going to re-write some of my website, taking out the side nav and only using the topnav

Next step is to go back in the coursework and look at how that should have been setup?


Adding Favorites to the Ads Application,
1: Add "this" to your ads/model.py, taking inspiration from dj4e-samples/favs/models.py:
Not done
2: Add two routes to your urls.py for the favorite features: Not done
path('ad/<int:pk>/favorite', views.AddFavoriteView.as_view(), name='ad_favorite'),
path('ad/<int:pk>/unfavorite', views.DeleteFavoriteView.as_view(), name='ad_unfavorite'),
3: Look at how ThingListView from dj4e-samples/favs/view.py retrieves the list of 
favorites for the current user and add code to your AdListView to retrieve the 
favorites for the current logged in user: Not done
4: Alter your ad_list.html by looking through favs/templates/favs/list.html Make sure 
to add the parts that show the stars based on the list of favorites for this user and 
the favPost() JavaScript code at the end: Not done
5: Pull in and adapt AddFavoriteView, and DeleteFavoriteView from 
dj4e-samples/favs/views.py into your views.py file: Not done

Extras: Remove "login" link from .com/ads/ page, this isn't needed. Clicking "Add an Ad"
while not logged in will lead you to the login page, login is also available on navbar.

8/25/23:
The website is now using the base_menu.html as the main template, this process is functional
but not pretty. I'll have to continue with this from a css perspective and get it to look nice.
8/28/23:
All of the sidebar has been moved to the top navbar, all link are styled the same.
This doesn't have a mouseover functionality. I think I do want to put that in.
Social login (github):
This redirects you to github, allows you to login, redirects you back to my site then
errors out.
AttributeError at /oauth/complete/github/
'NoneType' object has no attribute 'provider'
You are then logged into github's site but not my site. Obviously a bit of an issue.

8/29/23:
Last night around 9pm leonardo blocked my website from viewing, python anywhere can
still be accessed. So I can still edit but I'm not sure how to verify changes.
A message was sent to the "Report an incorrect block" Not sure what time frame these are
responded to in.
Project pause for vacation regardless.
