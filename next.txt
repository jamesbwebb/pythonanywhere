# stopped at Pulling in Code from Samples.
8/15/23: right now the problem is "Tried to create a record and cannot find the record in the list view"
The record has been created, I verified this in the admin panel.
The edit view works, so maybe I need to look at the view and edit views together.

Adding comments to the ads application:

#1: Update models.py - Done
#2: Pull CommentForm class into forms.py file -- Done

#3: Adapt the get() method from ForumDetailView to your AdDetailView to retrieve
#the list of comments and create the CommentForm and pass them into your
#templates/ads/ad_detail.html template through the context. -- Done

#4: Adapt the templates/ads/ad_detail.html template to show comments and show a delete
#icon when a comment belongs to the current logged in user -- Done

#5: Also add the ability to add a comment to an ad in ad_detail.html when the user is
#logged in by looking at the techniques in forums/templates/forums/detail.html --done

#6: Add a route in urls.py for the ad_comment_create and ad_comment_delete reoutes from
#forums/urls.py Makesure to use the same URL patterns as shown here: -- Done

#7: Adapt the comment related views from forums/views.py and put them into your views.py
#-- Done
#8: You will have to adapt the forums/templates/forums/comment_delete.html template to
#work in your ads applicaion. -- Done

#Next to work on:

Returned invalid syntax on 1st urls.py line copied from website.
Do CommentCreateView and CommentDeleteView exist in the views.py file? Yes, as classes
Fixed the syntax error, the urlpatterns list was missing a comma after the last element before
the forum addition was started.
New issue: TypeError
CommentCreateView() recieved an invalid keyword 'success_url'.as_view only accepts arguments
that are already attributes of the class. maybe check google on this one?
After looking into this one the line should have read .as_view() with no arguments passed
in, I had added some to conform to the other path objects and was mistaking in doing so
removing them fixed that issue.
New issue: NoReverseMatch at /ads/ad/42
Reverse for 'ad_comment_create' with arguments'(",)' not found. 1 pattern(s) tried:
 ['ads/ad/(?P<pk>[0-9]+/comments$']
Not sure why that argument is being passed in.

Also ads cannot be viewed when the user is not logged in, just shows '()'
Ads cannot be viewd when user is logged in, just shows '()'
I am very sure I had this working at one point.
I think it was something inside the ad_detail.html file with the ordering of lines.
The issue here was in the variable calling, 'ad' was called when 'ads' needed to be.

<!-- Had to go to the forums to find an two year old version and plug in the old
content number to pass the auto grader. -->

Week 4:
Do all of the Challenges,
#1: Make yourself a gravatar: Done - I went with bulbasaur and linked it to ja..bb@gmail.com
#2: Change your favicon.ico to a favicon of your own making: Done - Used bulbasaur again.
3: Make social login work: In progress.
I followed the tut video on coursera without anything erroring out and this is not working.
# I'm going to re-write some of my website, taking out the side nav and only using the topnav. Done

Next step is to go back in the coursework and look at how that should have been setup?
Watch the video provided through coursera again and go to the internet if additional instructions are needed.

Adding Favorites to the Ads Application, - On Hold pending completion of social login.
# 1: Add "this" to your ads/model.py, taking inspiration from dj4e-samples/favs/models.py:
# Done
# 2: Add two routes to your urls.py for the favorite features: Done
# path('ad/<int:pk>/favorite', views.AddFavoriteView.as_view(), name='ad_favorite'),
# path('ad/<int:pk>/unfavorite', views.DeleteFavoriteView.as_view(), name='ad_unfavorite'),
3: Look at how ThingListView from dj4e-samples/favs/view.py retrieves the list of
favorites for the current user and add code to your AdListView to retrieve the
favorites for the current logged in user: Not done
4: Alter your ad_list.html by looking through favs/templates/favs/list.html Make sure
to add the parts that show the stars based on the list of favorites for this user and
the favPost() JavaScript code at the end: Not done
5: Pull in and adapt AddFavoriteView, and DeleteFavoriteView from
dj4e-samples/favs/views.py into your views.py file: Verify

# Extras: Remove "login" link from .com/ads/ page, this isn't needed. Clicking "Add an Ad"
# while not logged in will lead you to the login page, login is also available on navbar.
# Done - login is now only available through navbar. Sidebar has been removed.

# 8/25/23:
# The website is now using the base_menu.html as the main template, this process is functional
# but not pretty. I'll have to continue with this from a css perspective and get it to look nice.
# Done - I went through and worked on the CSS, it now looks "nice".

8/28/23:
# All of the sidebar has been moved to the top navbar, all link are styled the same.
Add mouseover functionality to navbar links.

Social login (github):
This redirects you to github, allows you to login, redirects you back to my site then
errors out.
AttributeError at /oauth/complete/github/
'NoneType' object has no attribute 'provider'
You are then logged into github's site but not my site.

# 8/28/23:
# ~9pm leonardo blocked my website from viewing, python anywhere can still be accessed.
# So I can still edit but I'm not sure how to verify changes. A message was sent to the
# "Report an incorrect block" Not sure what time frame these are responded to in.
# Project pause for vacation regardless.
# Fixed - This site in no longer blocked.

9/12/23:
Time to troubleshoot the social authentication.
I ran the autograder which flagged a nogo for a lack of favorites.
Started integrating the favorites feature into the website, all the code is in
place, python manage.py check passes but the icons are not showing up. Still
Fixed the issue where the icons did not show. Next issue is both icons are shown
Make sure the links attached to the icons function correctly then fix the icon show/hidden toggle.

CSS is working correctly, but the js isn't?
I think the js is working correctly, the database value isn't being modified on click.
What if we take out the js and get the link to work?

# Tried to add the fav class to the admin page and errored out the page.
# Fixed the Fav not showing up in the admin page, forgot to import Fav
# into admin.py

Url failed with TypeError: Failed to execute 'getComputedStyle' on 'Window': parameter 1 is not of type 'Element'. /ads/ad/32/favorite
Error on click to favorite. Not sure.

Broke dropdown for logout menu. Check v1_base_bootstrap.html

I tried doing that without any luck getting it working again, the css is so full of copypasta
that it's hard to make heads or tails of it. I want to spend the time to go in and redo all
of it but that is well outside of the scope of this project. At the moment the logout
functionality is not working outside of the admin page. I can get a mouseover version of the
logout button working on another page but I'm not sure why it isn't working on the main page.
Possible conflicting/ overwriting names?
Maybe I should put a pin in the favorites part of the project and youtube how to get the
social login working with github.ttributeError at /oauth/complete/github/

'NoneType' object has no attribute 'provider'

tried
pip install social-auth-core==3.3.3
pip install social-auth-app-django==4.0.0
to get the social login working, following a stack overflow suggestion.
I think I broke something and I'm not sure how to fix it.

change force_text to force_str
Looks like my version of django was outdated. updated to 4.2.3
Did a pip install requirements4.txt and fixed the aforementioned issue. Still don't have
social login working.

currently working with
social-auth-core=4.4.2
social-auth-app-django=5.2.0

After checking the coursera forums for this section it seems the issue I've been having
with the social login is between pythonanywhere and github, for the forum user the
problem didn't happen when they hosted locally.

9/19/23:
I'm finding this project progresssing very slowly and causing my much frustration.
the adfavorite button is verified working but it still flags the above error.
The jquery? or js that is in the walkthrough video is not the same code as is in the
git repository for this project, I could find no explanation as to why this was
changed. Should I try to copy the code out of the video? I think that's what I'm
having issues with but I'm not sure it would work if I pulled it out.
Maybe this is time for me to ask for help.

9/20/23:
Trying a different approach where I just youtube the thing I'm trying to do and
develop the feature independently of the coursera material.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XiJvIuvqhs
I have this setup but also not working correctly yet, this uses a heart icon and shows
the correct, filled/unfilled, value based on the database entry. Clicking the icon
405 errors so I'll have to look into that, also this icon won't update the database.

So the star icon enters into the database correctly but vizualizes funny. The hearts
vizualize correctly but don't interface with the backend correctly. this is kind of
funny to me.

9/22/23
And like magic I've completed section 4 of the class.
