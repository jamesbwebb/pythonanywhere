Project goals:

Create a kana flash card styled web app.

Requirements:

I'll have to source some images, both the individual characters and the full chart.
Text box + stubmit button # look to files in mysite/main for reference.
Validation:
if answer.isvalid # check syntax
	if lower(answer) == correct:
		something
	else:
		shows correct answer
else:
	use the integrated django stuff for this part, look to the mysite/main app for references

Path to goal:
1: Create text box + submit button
2: Create simple validation, base this off the above example
3: Create both pass and fail cases
4: Image integration, start with one static, then add the rest and randomize.

I think I'll have to pass info with a simple form/ post request
Create a database entry for the correct answers.

Extras: Add a next or skip button.

Update:
database filled with entries of hiragana and english character answers.
These load randomly to the webpage
A skip button reloads the page and thusly randomizes the character.
Decided to go with text integration for the characters instead of images.
Currently working on the textbox/submit button/ correct answer validation.
